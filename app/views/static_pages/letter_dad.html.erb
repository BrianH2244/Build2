Since I created this exercise, it's only appropriate I start it off as well.

Most families have their dysfunctional elements. My father and I haven't had the closest relationship over the years, which is why I decided to share the things I appreciate most from our relationship. Here's is the letter I emailed him.

"Hi Dad,

I know we don't talk much about feelings or emotional events in general, usually sticking to politics, the economy, or health related stuff. However as I've gotten older, it appears easier to perhaps see things from your perspective. Possibly because I'm getting older and having to go through similar life events you've once had to go through or being that we have similar personalities, I'm not sure.

I've noticed for myself, when going through difficulties I can often get caught up in self-preservation, usually at the expense of my relationships. It can be hard to focus on helping others when more pressing personal needs are at stake.

It seems the older I get the more similarities I tend to see between us, which probably means you also understand me to a greater degree than most people. One of the characteristics I've most admired, is your ability to be non-judgemental through many of the hardships I've undergone. Whether it was temporarily dropping out of university and changing majors, break-ups with girlfriends or pursuing self-employment, you've been supportive throughout everything and I appreciate it.

My struggles with depression alongside your own, and the perspective it's given me on the whole I believe, has given me a greater appreciation for the times you've been there for me. I wanted to let you know how positively our relationship has impacted me, and that you've done right by me as a father.

Love Brian"

Letters like that kind be emotionally difficult to write not to mention pressing send afterwards! :)
