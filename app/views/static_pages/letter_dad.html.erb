Since I created this exercise it's only appropriate I start it off as well.

Most families have their dysfunctional elements. My father and I haven't had the closest relationship over the years, which is why I decided to share the things I do appreciate from our relationship. Here's is the letter I emailed him...

"Hi Dad,

I know we don't talk much about feelings or emotional events in general, usually sticking to politics, the economy, or health related stuff.

However as I've gotten older it seems easier to see things from your perspective, maybe because I'm getting older and having to go through similar circumstances you once went through. I've noticed for myself... when going through hardships I can often get caught up in self-preservation, usually at the expense of my relationships. It can be hard to focus on helping others when more pressing personal needs are at stake.

The older I get the more similarities I tend to see between us, which probably means you also understand me to a greater degree than most people. One of characteristics I've most admired about you is your ability to be non-judgemental through a number of the hardships I've undergone. Whether it was dropping out of university to change majors, break-ups with girlfriends, or pursuing self-employment you've been supportive throughout everything.

My struggles with depression alongside your own, and the perspective it's given me on the whole I believe, has given me a greater appreciation for the times you have been able to be supportive. I wanted to let you know it's been very important to me
