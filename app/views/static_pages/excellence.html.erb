Pushing Forward Towards Excellence

I began an experiment today focusing on just 5 minute intervals working towards a desired goal I've set for myself.  The jist of it...


Spend 5 minutes working on things I want to improve in my life. Examples for me.

Work on this website.
Exercise.

The main tenets to this exercise are;

Try to get as much quality out of that 5 minutes as I can.
Get in to a creative/productive/resourceful state of mind.

Create a timer that goes off after 5 minutes.
Have people check off the completion of a task.
Have them describe what their method of completion was.
Have them create a finishing exercise to reward their behaviour.

Training Wheels for the Mind: Get started and live in the moment
