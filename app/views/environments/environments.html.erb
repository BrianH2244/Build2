<h1>Small, Smart Choices + Consistency + time = RADICAL DIFFERENCE</h1>

<h2>Surround yourself with people that make sure you live by your principles, each and every day,<br>until you couldn't live any other way even if you tried.</h2>

<h3>Write out a few excuses you might be clinging to (e.g., not smart enough, no experience, wrong upbringing, don't have the education, etc.). Decide to make up in hard work and personal development to outcompete anyone - including your old self</h3>

<p>Excuses: I don't have the energy. I get too stressed out. I'm being unrealistic.</p>
<p>I am deciding to outcompete myself everyday. I can see things others can't. I can make my mark on the world. </p>

<h3>Write out the half-dozen small, seemingly inconsequential steps you can take every day that can take your life in a completely new and positive direction.</h3>

<p>1. Read self-help material everyday.</p>
<p>2. Work on my mobility everyday.</p>
<p>3. Spend time with friends.</p>
<p>4. Go for walks more. They help me think and gain perspective.</p>
<p>5. Let go of my future aspirations of greatness. Focus on what I need to do today.</p>
<p>6. Make a concerted effort to know more people in my life. Make contacts. Talk to more people anywhere. Hold conversations about things I'm interested on the internet.</p>

<h3>Write down the small, seemingly inconsequential actions you can stop doing that might be compounding your results downward.</h3>

<p>Stop wasting time on reddit, OKC, men's rights/feminism, video games, day-dreaming/fantisizing about the future.</p>

<h3>List a few areas, skills, or outcomes where you have been most successful in the past. Consider whether you could be taking those for granted and are not continuing to improve, and are therefore in jeopardy of having that complacency lead to future failure.</h3>

<p>Managing my eating, exercise, and supplement habits.</p>
<p>Good at sports and enjoying being competitive.</p>
<p>Obsessing about interests of mine, and trouble shooting problems.</p>
